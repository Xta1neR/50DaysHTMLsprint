This is the first project for the repository. 
The basic HTML CSS and JS files do the below task. 

INDEX.HTML : Renders all the panels inside a div class.
CSS : Styles the panels and the text. We are using flexbox over here to display these panels easily. We also used transitions for smooth rendering. 
JS : This is the main file where we are using the DOM to add event listeners to the panels. The JS has 2 functions only 
panel.classList.add('active') and panel.classList.remove('active').
